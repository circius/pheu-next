I spent a lot of time in the last 10 years in and out of the [British Library](https://bl.uk).

To soothe an occasional annoyance, I wrote a little scraper with Python and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) to let me know what the status of my book-requests was in the terminal.

I wrote a similar script, borrowing code, for the university library; that one was scheduled with [cron job](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/crontab.5.html) to renew all my books once per week. Highly recommended.
