 I spent a lot of time in the last 10 years in and out of the British Library.

To soothe an occasional annoyance, I wrote a little scraper with Python and Beautiful Soup to let me know what the status of my book-requests was in the terminal.

I wrote a similar script, borrowing code, for the university library; that one was scheduled with cron job to renew all my books once per week. Highly recommended.
