# byo-yomi (2017)
 When I wanted to play the japanese game go with a friend over the
 board, we couldn't find a straightforward timer that would work on
 his phone.

Naively, i thought I could do better. I wrote this app with the
beautiful javascript framework [mithril](https://mithril.js.org/), and everything was done within
a couple of day's worth of fiddling.

I thought we'd just be able to load the [live version](https://circius.github.io/byo-yomi/#!/menu) on a phone and
leave it beside the board. I hadn't counted with power-saving: it's
not so easy to keep a mobile phone awake while you're thinking about a
move.
