During the summer of 2020, a friend in Brighton was running a
voluntary just-in-time furniture delivery service that took furniture
from people who wanted to get rid of it and delivered it to people who
needed it - all without handling any money at all.

She was organising all of this with a spreadsheet, gmail search, and
her memory! I helped her transition to an [airtable](https://airtable.com/) (a really useful
cross between a database and a spreadsheet). Then I built a kind of
'marketplace' frontend (online [here](https://app.mabdonations.org/)) with [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/) / [airtable.py](https://github.com/josephbestjames/airtable.py) and
[auth0](https://auth0.com/) so that people who needed furniture could choose from what was
available.
