When the pandemic hit and the hard lockdowns of 2020 were imposed, I
decided with some friends to play the infamously cruel boardgame [Diplomacy](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/483/diplomacy) online at [webdiplomacy](https://webdiplomacy.net/).

Webdiplomacy doesn't offer notifications, so I wrote dipbot, a little
[Discord](https://discord.com/) bot based on [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). When asked to, dipbot would scrape
the current status of our game and report the most important
information about that state; most importantly: who hadn't submitted
their turns yet.
