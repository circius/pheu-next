Hello! Welcome to this very rough first draft of a personal website.

At the moment, this website outlines my [technical skills](/skills), and
presents a few of the more finished [projects](/projects) I've completed over
the years.

All these projects are simple, and they look even simpler! but - us anyone who looks at their source code will, I hope, agree - for small personal projects they're carefully and solidly built.

You can get in touch with me [here](/here). I hope you do!
