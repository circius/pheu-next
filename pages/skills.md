# languages

## python - _intermediate_

- total condidence with core language features
- extensive experience with the standard library
- good knowledge of tools for testing and distribution

## javascript - _intermediate_

- total confidence with modern, functional javascript
- considerable confidence with the tooling that goes with it (webpack, babel &c

## racket - _intermediate_

a labour of love: after completing [How to Design Programs](https://https://htdp.org/2020-8-1/Book/index.html), which is taught in a minimal MIT-style lisp/scheme, progressing to the course-designer's [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) felt automatic. But I haven't got around to building anything other than toys and little utilities in it, yet.

## smalltalk - _beginner_

I learnt enough smalltalk to love it - while I was trying to understand what [object-oriented programming](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/OO_programming/) was about - but never enough to build anything more than toys in it. Working in a [smalltalk VM](https://pharo.org/) is like heaven.

# frameworks, front and back

## react/js, express/js - _advanced beginner_

- recently completed the Helsinki University [Fullstack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/) course, which heavily focuses on full-stack javascript with React and Express. This website is build with the React framework [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)

## flask/python - _intermediate_

- clear understanding of project architecture and best practices, deriving from
- multiple completed personal projects

# servers and systems

## linux - _intermediate_

- 15 years of personal use has left me comfortable navigating and administering linux systems

## docker - _advanced beginner_

- Recently I've been using docker to ensure reliable deployment of my personal projects
- That means I'm comfortable writing and maintaining dockerfiles
- and deploying them to services like heroku or the self-hosted caprover.
- This website's hosted on a caprover instance!

## code samples

Sample code in Racket, Bash and Smalltalk can easily be found at my [exercism profile](https://exercism.io/profiles/circius). I'm happy with all of the code there, even if these are, of course, toy questions.

My equivalent work with Python and Javascript is at [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/circius), where unfortunately the interface is harder to navigate.

Code for some of my [projects](https://pheu.org/#projects) can be found on my [github profile](https://github.com/circius).

## education

Undoubtedly the pinnacle of my self-education up to this point has been working through the user-friendly successor to the infamous [SICP](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html), [How to Design Programs](https://htdp.org/2020-8-1/Book/index.html), which emphasises cautious, reflective, unit-tested development function-by-function. I try, as far as possible, to keep up its methods in all the programming I do.
