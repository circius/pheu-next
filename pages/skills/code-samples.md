Sample code in Racket, Bash and Smalltalk can easily be found at my [exercism profile](https://exercism.io/profiles/circius). I'm happy with all of the code there, even if these are, of course, toy questions.

My equivalent work with Python and Javascript is at [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/circius), where unfortunately the interface is harder to navigate.

Code for some of my [projects](https://pheu.org/#projects) can be found on my [github profile](https://github.com/circius).
