## linux - _intermediate_

- 15 years of personal use has left me comfortable navigating and administering linux systems

## docker - _advanced beginner_

- Recently I've been using docker to ensure reliable deployment of my personal projects
- That means I'm comfortable writing and maintaining dockerfiles
- and deploying them to services like heroku or the self-hosted caprover.
- This website's hosted on a caprover instance!
