## javascript - _intermediate_

## racket - _intermediate_

a labour of love: after completing [How to Design Programs](https://https://htdp.org/2020-8-1/Book/index.html), which is taught in a minimal MIT-style lisp/scheme, progressing to the course-designer's [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) felt automatic. But I haven't got around to building anything other than toys and little utilities in it, yet.

## smalltalk - _beginner_

I learnt enough smalltalk to love it - while I was trying to understand what [object-oriented programming](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/OO_programming/) was about - but never enough to build anything more than toys in it. Working in a [smalltalk VM](https://pharo.org/) is like heaven.
